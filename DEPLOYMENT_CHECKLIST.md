## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Deployment Verification
- [x] âœ… app.py - Main Gradio application
- [x] âœ… requirements.txt - Dependencies file
- [x] âœ… README.md - Space configuration with metadata
- [x] âœ… output/best_insurance_model.pkl - Trained model
- [x] âœ… output/encoders.pkl - Label encoders
- [x] âœ… output/scalers.pkl - Feature scalers

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create Hugging Face Space
- [ ] Go to https://huggingface.co/spaces
- [ ] Click "Create new Space"
- [ ] Enter Space name: `medical-insurance-predictor`
- [ ] Select Owner: `TNThom`
- [ ] Choose SDK: `Gradio`
- [ ] Select Hardware: `CPU basic (free)`
- [ ] Set Visibility: `Public`
- [ ] Click "Create Space"

### Step 2: Upload Files
- [ ] Upload `app.py`
- [ ] Upload `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Upload `README.md`
- [ ] Create `output/` folder
- [ ] Upload `output/best_insurance_model.pkl`
- [ ] Upload `output/encoders.pkl`
- [ ] Upload `output/scalers.pkl`

### Step 3: Wait for Build
- [ ] Monitor build logs for completion
- [ ] Wait for "Running" status (usually 2-5 minutes)
- [ ] Check for any error messages

### Step 4: Test Application
- [ ] Visit your Space URL: https://huggingface.co/spaces/TNThom/medical-insurance-predictor
- [ ] Test prediction with default values
- [ ] Try different age values (18-100)
- [ ] Test different BMI values (15-60)
- [ ] Test smoking vs non-smoking scenarios
- [ ] Verify risk assessment changes appropriately
- [ ] Test all 5 example cases
- [ ] Check cost breakdown calculations

### Step 5: Verification Tests

#### Test Case 1: Low Risk Profile
- [ ] Age: 25, Sex: Female, BMI: 22.5, Children: 0, Smoker: No, Region: Northeast
- [ ] Expected: Low risk, reasonable cost (~$2,000-4,000)

#### Test Case 2: High Risk Profile  
- [ ] Age: 45, Sex: Male, BMI: 28, Children: 2, Smoker: Yes, Region: Southeast
- [ ] Expected: High risk, higher cost (~$10,000-15,000)

#### Test Case 3: Medium Risk Profile
- [ ] Age: 35, Sex: Female, BMI: 32, Children: 1, Smoker: No, Region: Northwest
- [ ] Expected: Medium risk, moderate cost (~$5,000-8,000)

### Step 6: Final Checks
- [ ] All UI elements display correctly
- [ ] Predictions complete within 2-3 seconds
- [ ] Risk levels display with appropriate colors/emojis
- [ ] Cost breakdown shows annual, monthly, weekly
- [ ] Examples section works properly
- [ ] About section expands/collapses correctly
- [ ] No error messages in browser console

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria
- [ ] Space builds successfully without errors
- [ ] Application loads and displays properly
- [ ] All predictions work accurately
- [ ] Risk assessment functions correctly
- [ ] UI is responsive and professional
- [ ] All test cases pass
- [ ] Public URL is accessible

## ðŸ“ž Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails:
1. Check build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all files uploaded correctly
3. Ensure requirements.txt has correct dependencies
4. Check that model files are not corrupted

### If Predictions Don't Work:
1. Verify model files are in correct location (`output/` folder)
2. Check that all three .pkl files are present
3. Review error logs for model loading issues

### If UI Looks Wrong:
1. Clear browser cache and refresh
2. Check that README.md has correct metadata header
3. Verify app.py uploaded completely

## ðŸŽ‰ Deployment Complete!
